The current project, Odin Recipes is the first project in the full stack development course "The Odin Project" after learning about some of the basics stuff about HTML like: HTML boilerplate, link, paragraph, image and heading tags.

In this project, I will apply the knowledge that i have accumulated and use images, anchor heading and paragraph tags.
